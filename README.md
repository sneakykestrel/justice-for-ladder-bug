# Justice For Ladder Bug mod for I Am Your Beast

did you know ladders and walls used to fling you 27km away when you climb them sometimes? 
this mod adds that as a feature because its (objectively) awesome

You can customise:

- Strength of the fling
- Chance for the fling to happen
- Scale, frequency and length of screenshake caused by the fling


# Installation

!!! You need [Bepinex 6](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.2) for mono !!!
(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2 and it might work. maybe)

Once bepinex is installed, put the dll into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

have fun :3
